# parcel-optimizer-friendly-urls
> Remove `index.html` from internal links in Parcel's build output.

[Parcel][parcel] is great, but unfortunately the HTML build output will include a trailing `index.html` for internal links. This plugin will remove `index.html` from all internal links using [PostHTML][posthtml], making your URLs beautiful again. External URLs not part of your Parcel build will be left untouched.

## Examples
Things this plugin will replace:
* `<a href="/contact/index.html">` to `<a href="/contact/">`.
* `<link href="/contact/index.html" rel="canonical" />` to `<link href="/contact/" rel="canonical" />`.
* `<a href="http://local.dev/contact/index.html">` to `<a href="http://local.dev/contact/">` if using the `publicUrl` target property or `--public-url http://local.dev` build flag.

Things this plugin will not replace:
* `<a href="https://www.example.com/index.html">`
* `<p>This is a sample text mentioning index.html</p>`

## Installation
Depending on which package manager you use, either:
* `$ npm install --save-dev parcel-optimizer-friendly-urls`
* `$ yarn add --dev parcel-optimizer-friendly-urls`

Next, add the plugin to the optimizer entry in your `.parcelrc`:

```json
{
  "extends": ["@parcel/config-default"],
  "optimizers": {
    "*.html": ["parcel-optimizer-friendly-urls", "@parcel/optimizer-htmlnano"]
  },
  ...
}
```

## Usage
Parcel now automatically picks up on this plugin, and no further action is required on your part.
